# Neural Network Tumor Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting tumors from medical imaging using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The project uses Python and TensorFlow to train a CNN on a dataset of MRI scans to automatically identify and classify potential tumors.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that includes:
- Convolutional layers to capture spatial features from the MRI scans.
- Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and computation.
- Dense layers for classification output.
- Activation functions such as ReLU and a softmax layer for binary classification (tumor or no tumor).

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- TensorFlow 2.4
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset.
